<b>About me</b>
<br>
<br>
<p5>I am a certified as a Master Practitioner of Neuro-Linguistic Programming and NLP+® 
<br>
<br>
    Are you considering a career change or feeling unfulfilled in your current role? 
    Feeling unchallenged like you are not reaching your potential? 
    Struggling to balance work and home life?
    Unclear about your purpose in life?
    Having confidence issues and feel that imposter syndrome in your new role?
    Doubting yourself and lacking the self belief to make changes? 
    <br>
    <br>
    I know what it is like to feel stuck, like there is no way out. 
    After struggling to get work in my field after completing my masters when I did land my first job it was very disheartening.
    The work environment was toxic, stressful. Everyone was out to get each other! I spent a lot of time trying to prove I was not competing against others. 
    I was just making my own journey in this industry. Having worked in the NHS and private companies, I can guarantee it does not matter where you work.
     There will be good and bad points at any workplace. 
    What is important is that you are taking action to take charge of your life and career. 
    <br>
    Since I took responsibility for my career, my life has changed. I have and I am continuing to use the tools and resources available to me to invest in myself.
    <br>
    <br>
    I want to help you in your career to use your strengths to work towards your true purpose in life to feel fulfilled in all areas of your life.

   <b> <head>What is NLP?</head></b>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p6>Neuro Linguistic Programming was originally developed by Richard Bandler &
        John Grinder who wanted to identify patterns of thoughts & behaviours of successful individuals & teach them to others. 
<br>
<br>
        NLP works using active imagination, where the client has to follow instructions and actively imagine what is being suggested
        <br>
        <br>
      <i> “NLP is an Attitude & Methodology that leaves behind a Trail of Techniques” – Richard Bandler </i>
